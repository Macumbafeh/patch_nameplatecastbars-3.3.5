# patch_nameplatecastbars-3.3.5

You are looking for an addon to see the castbars under every player nameplates without targetting them or having them on focus.
you got to path your wow.exe with it.

It doesn't work with TidyPlates
It works with KuiNameplates (you just not have the name of the spell)
It doesn't work with default castbar of NotPlater, but it add the blizzard castbar

/!\ Make sure it's allowed on your server before to install it !
